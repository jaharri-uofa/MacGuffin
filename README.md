Hello physics peeps,

This is the MacGuffin, a comprehensive and ever updating formula sheet for PHYS 234, Introduction to Computational Phyiscs.

The purpose of this is to minimize studying, and collaborate to create one master formula sheet for the course, but we need to be careful...
1.) When using this code its important that you flavour it to your coding abilitys, while collaboration on assignmnets is allowed (I have emailed the prof to clarify this!) I do not want everyone submitting the same stuff
2.) I will lock this page down on the day of the final, as using the github is a breach of academic conduct (no collaboration)

Everyone is invited to edit the code but when you do please do the following...
1.) Leave comments detailing your code as best as possible
2.) Keep the code generalizable, applicable to a wide amount of functions
3.) Leave your email/username on sections you created, so if people have questions they know who to ask

Thanks! Happy Coding,

Jordan
